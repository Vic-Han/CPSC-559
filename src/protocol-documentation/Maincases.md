Initial connection:

The client has access to the load balancers IP and port#

The client should ask the load balancer for an available server

After recieving the request, the load balancer will ask(in a round robin format) the next server to see if it is currently connected with a client. 

The server may handle several connections to several clients in the future.

Server must repsond with either a yes or no. 

See Failure.md for what to do if the server does not respond.

The load balancer will continue to ask each server until it recieves a yes.

Once the load balancer finds an available server, it will send the IP/port of the server as well as an authentication code to the client.

The client will handshake(send to server, server acks, client acks) using the auth code and setup a connection.

From here the client can start asking for services such as login and file transfer.
